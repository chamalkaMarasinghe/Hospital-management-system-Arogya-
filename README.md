# Hospital-management-system-Arogya
## Overview
Managing doctors, patients, ambulances, lab services, pharmacies, wards, channelling services, 
between doctor communication, employees, and inventories was the primary objective of this project. 
The day-to-day patient management process is made simpler by this system for managing hospital 
services. Furthermore, our technology develops from a manual, traditional approach used in the field to 
an automated, systematic approach. We wish to improve their current paperwork by transferring their 
current approaches and procedures to a web application that is computer-based, and we can do that with 
the aid of authentication and authorization procedures. We are expecting to implement our system with 
more secure and highly accuracy components.
